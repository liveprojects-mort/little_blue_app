# Adding Bluetooth LE to LittleList

1. Plugins

   1. https://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central
      1. Will need this to provide BLE scanning
      2. also: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-ble-central
   2. https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin
      1. May need this, to provide permissions

2. How-to:

   1. https://www.sitepoint.com/communicating-with-bluetooth-low-energy-devices-in-cordova/
      1. Old, may need something a bit more recent

3. Go!

   1. First, makes sure app is building and all is OK with build tools
      1. Done!
   2.  `ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ble-central`
   3. In the `eventService`, we got rid of the dummy code for generating events.
   4. From the code examples, we put in a `startScan` function into the `eventService` which is now called by `updateEvents`.
   5. `startScan` returns a promise, which is fulfilled after 10 seconds, thanks to a timeout. It calls the `ble.startScan` function, which simply scans for advertising BLE devices, and adds their basic information to an array.
   6. The array is cached within the service, is accessible by the list control.

4. Problems

   1. Currently, the `ble.startScan` function is returning the MAC address of the Pi, and some other data, but no 'friendly name', which we expected from the docs. Need to find out why.
